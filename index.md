This project uses Vuforia and Unity to create two knickknacks, akin to something you would find in a gift 
shop but with some added technological flare. The two locations depicted are Kennedy Space Center and the pyramid Castillo de Kukulcán, which each feature a 3D representation of the actual location (a rocket and the pyramid respectively). In addition to the standard likeness, both knickknacks give the weather at each location, and if it is raining at the location it will be raining on the model (or rain can be triggered from the raindrop buttons in the app). The Kennedy Space Center model even plays Gustav Holst’s Mars to set the atmosphere and the rocket will launch if you press the red button. They also both function as magic 8 balls, allowing the user to turn them over and back to get a new saying. A simple smartphone application allows anyone to print out the base cubes and view these AR knickknacks through their phone as though the paper cubes were models of each location.\
A second application allows the user to take the Kennedy Space Center knickknack and place a supersized version of it wherever they would like by detecting the ground with the smartphone camera and simulating the model on a click.\

# Project2 ScareCo
This project uses the VRTK package in Unity to create a VR experience designed for the Oculus Quest. The project simulates a fictional startup, “ScareCo,” that is using various objects such as toys and boardgames to help people get over their fear of family game night. The company is using their friendly environment to slowly introduce people to family games to alleviate their fear, and if the patient were to run to a single-player game such as the nearby arcade console they are discouraged as more board games are generated.\
The environment features a highly interactable environment with a fully functional chess board with sound effects, various game facades, a Gameboy that plays the Tetris theme music, an oversized gaming die with sound, alongside others. Outside the ScareCo building there a garden scene enclosed in a glass dome with the universe slowly swirling around. A full list of models, links to the project, instillation instructions, and a video demo are available below.\

VR4FND\
VR Prosthesis Embodiment studies has shown that amputee patients can reduce phantom limb related issues and embody their prosthetics by assuming a virtual prosthetic in VR and training the patient using the simulation that certain sensory cues mean certain types of feedback. 
A prosthetic cannot “feel” in the traditional sense, but it can stimulate the remaining portion of the patient’s limb through small vibrations or other stimuli. Phantom limb syndrome, the feeling that their missing limb is still intact and certain sensations are felt in the phantom limb, is a functional neurological disorder (FND) that can cause patients to feel phantom pain and interpret stimuli to other parts of the body as touches to their nonexistent limb in a process called limb telescoping. Experiments simulating the prosthetic and allowing the patient to interact while feeling the prosthetic feedback in real life while seeing an entirely virtual body have shown promise in training those who experience limb telescoping to experience stimuli from their prosthetic as stimulation to the phantom limb that it replaced, decreasing discomfort and allowing for a “real” sensory experience.\
Since 2016, 30 patients at Stanford have been involved in clinical trials for such a technology called VR4FND .
VR4FND is an experimental therapy application that is in clinical trials which uses this VR prosthetic limb therapy to treat FND’s by immersing the patient in a VR mirror visual feedback system, that is a VR environment that mirrors actual motions, and provide the patient with actual touches on their body synchronized with a glowing light on the portion of the body the sensation would be correlated to in order to train the brain that a touch on a certain point, say a buzz on their amputated arm, correlated to a touch on the prosthetic, say the fingertip.\
The technology is still undergoing clinical trials which are projected to conclude December of this year with results projected by January 2022.\
