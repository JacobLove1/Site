# Project1 KnickKnack
This project uses Vuforia and Unity to create two knickknacks, akin to something you would find in a gift 
shop but with some added technological flare. The two locations depicted are Kennedy Space Center and the pyramid Castillo de Kukulcán, which each feature a 3D representation of the actual location (a rocket and the pyramid respectively). In addition to the standard likeness, both knickknacks give the weather at each location, and if it is raining at the location, it will be raining on the model. The Kennedy Space Center model even plays Gustav Holst’s Mars to set the atmosphere. They also both function as magic 8 balls, allowing the user to turn them over and back to get a new saying. A simple smartphone application allows anyone to print out the base cubes and view these AR knickknacks through their phone as though the paper cubes were models of each location.\
A second application allows the user to take the Kennedy Space Center knickknack and place a supersized version of it wherever they would like by detecting the ground with the smartphone camera and simulating the model on a click.\
